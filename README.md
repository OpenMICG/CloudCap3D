# CloudCap3D: Enhancing 3D In-Scene Descriptions via Point Cloud Integration and Efficient Text Filtering
We publicly release the CloudCap3D dataset. The motivation for creating this dataset is to address the issue of low-quality and semantically poor generated text caused by the lack of 3D point cloud data. We leverage the existing Objaverse dataset and expand it into CloudCap3D, a dataset with 3D object-text pairs, providing a large number of 3D object-text pairs with richer semantics.
The dataset can be used for 3D multimodal tasks.

# Evaluation metric
Traditional evaluation metrics often focus narrowly on specific aspects, such as the alignment between a generated 3D object and the corresponding text, which may not accurately reflect human judgments. Recent research has highlighted the potential of using GPT-4V for evaluating text-to-3D object generation tasks, as it offers a more comprehensive assessment that better mirrors human preferences. Building on these findings, we have adopted and
refined the cue word methodology proposed in previous studies.
